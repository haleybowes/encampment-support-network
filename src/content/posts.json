And remember, every time you donate or purchase something for your neighbours in tents, let your city councillor and John Tory know that you want more RGI housing in the city.

But from the vast majority the message is clear give us housing. Not hotels with curfews on the outskirts of town away for social services.  Not dressed up institutionalisation. Housing with social supports. Till then, turn on the water and take care of the people. Everyone who donates water and goods - we are so grateful. We are doing the bare minimum to keep people hydrated, as the city turns its back. Please make sure you write to John Tory and voice your support for opening housing.  When the NIMbYs complain of visible poverty and fearing violence, lets remember that if this wasnt happening  out in the open, it would still be happening and hidden.  The widespread and continual violence people endure happens at the hands of indifferent capitalists, the police, and politicians who dont care about their poorest constituents."

This week, the City of Toronto released pictures on Twitter of the Better Living Centre, a respite centre intended to shelter 100 people. Within hours, hundreds of Twitter users responded with horror, comparing the centres rows of sparse plexiglass pods to pictures of immigration detention centres made infamous under the Trump administration. People who have slept at the Better Living Centre this week report that cameras throughout the facility surveil them constantly, that lights are kept on 24 hours each day, and that people must shower in cold water in trailers. Still, city workers are pushing residents of the Scadding Court encampment to move. Some residents have accepted the citys offer. Others have refused. Now, they expect to be forcefully evicted from the park. Domenico Saxida, a resident of Scadding Court said, The city is planning mass evictions from the parks because we dont want to live in their congregate shelters. Hundreds of people a few feet apart in plexiglass? Ill take my chances on the street. Domenico has spent time in city shelters and said he didnt feel safe in them. He compared them to dog kennels, saying dogs at the humane society get treated better. But at the park, Domenico said, there is community. He said neighbours from surrounding houses graciously bring heaters and food, and criticized the city for trying to make homelessness invisible. They arent worried about our safety, he said, they just want us out the way. Im trying to survive out here, end of story. These people are my family, we are not moving out of this park. ...",

		"title": "WHY IS THE CITY OF TORONTO BEING TAKEN TO COURT BY UNHOUSED PEOPLE TWICE ON THURSDAY OCTOBER 1? Tomorrow, Thursday October 1st, the city of Toronto goes to court twice against people who are unhoused and their advocates.  One case is about encampments and charter rights. The bodies going to court are: * 13 encampments residents, * Toronto Overdose Prevention Society* Ontario Coalition Against Poverty This is a lawsuit against the City of Toronto for its enforcement of Park by-laws that allow law enforcement to evict people for trespassing because they are camping in public parks. The lawsuit says that eviction for camping is unconstitutional during COVID-19 because alternative shelter is unavailable or where it is available it is unsafe. The other case sees a return to court for the City of Toronto regarding shelters enforcing physical distancing - the Coalition of groups going to court includes: * Sanctuary Ministries of Toronto* Aboriginal Legal Services (ALS)* Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario (ACTO)* Black Legal Action Centre (BLAC)* Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA)* HIV & AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario (HALCO) The City of Toronto is putting the lives of those experiencing homelessness as well as shelter workers at risk by failing to meet minimum physical distancing standards. A coalition of human rights and housing advocates say the City is not meeting its obligations under a binding settlement agreement it made a few months ago, to ensure homeless shelters meet physical distancing standards. As a result of this serious failure, the coalition is taking the City back to the Ontario Superior Court for a hearing on October 1.",

Weve noticed that for the entire summer the media has largely neglected speaking to people living in encampments, privileging the voices of NIMBYs and regurgitating the (confusing) numbers served by City of Toronto PR about how many ppl theyve housed. This can really flatten the complex reality of ppl and leads to one size fits all solutions to the housing crisis (and as were seeing in Toronto, soft institutionalization in the form of shelter hotels).

This kind of thing happens on a regular basis. people need to know what's going on.  + + + CW POLICE VIOLENCE / ANTI-BLACK RACISM + + +  Sometime last night, maybe around midnight, police swarmed a large group of Black men on the North Side of the park. From what I know, it was a pretty quiet night in the park, people were hanging out and listening to music. The police came to Derek's tent, his home, and busted in with their guns drawn, telling everyone to get down. They said they had a warrant, but never produced one or showed it when they were asked. They handcuffed all the bystanders outside, making it impossible for anyone to film what was happening. A man, who wishes to remain anonymous, was at the entrance to the tent - he was beaten, they dragged him down and knocked him out. While he was unconscious, an ambulance was called, and they kept him pinned to the ground, handcuffed, with a knee on his chest. He said that they told him he had to make a choice, go to jail, or go to the hospital. When the paramedics came, the police told them that he had overdosed. They put him in the ambulance and told the police that since he was still handcuffed, the police would have to ride with them to the hospital, to which the police officer replied, \"never mind\" and took the cuffs off. At the hospital (St. Mikes), with a dislocated shoulder, the paramedics told the doctors that he was faking and nothing was wrong with him - the doctors said they had other patients to deal with, and told him to leave and sleep it off. The police entered and completely destroyed Derek's home. They slashed his two tents, ripping them to shreds. They slashed all of the tarps, they cut up his air mattress, his bed, and broke most of his belongings. When they entered, they dragged him out into the dark of the night and beat the fuck out of him. They said they were looking for a gun, which is a pretty common tactic they use to illegally search and brutalize, and obviously none was found, nothing was seized and no charges were laid, nothing. I repeat, (contd in comments)"

People came through and ate some hot dogs and watermelons and chips and drinks and listened to some beautiful music by Tica Holiday and Nick Dourado.  We delivered a bunch of dogs and drinks to residents too. Our allied yoga practitioner Indu Vashist even opened the day. Harm reduction workers were on hand and gave trainings to local residents who wanted to learn how to reverse ODs. Even our behind the scenes sign coordinator @club.waaa was there. Thank you to everyone who repped today and we are so glad the counter protestors did their thing and made it tense for the terrible crusaders.  Lots of love to everyone. Photos by @jeffari",

We have never seen the city come through with water - they disturb people in their homes, count tents and take photos of them. Its surveillance not safety. Parks ambassadors telling residents and ESN to work with Streets To Homes(S2H), but Streets To Homes hasnt come by- we know because ESN volunteers have been in the parks almost everyday for 5 weeks and residents at bellwoods havent seen S2H once. People want housing, but instead funding is  put into surveillance masked by wellness and paternalism. @cityofto what gives???",

The whole process is very confusing, mostly because there are so many people with different needs and what the city has on offer is limited and comes with limitations. Hotels have been converted to make-shift shelters, complete with workers and lots of rules and restrictions. TV's have been taken out, beds and furniture have been replaced. Right now most of the rooms are double occupancy, which means that in some cases they offer less privacy than a tent. There are no visitors allowed, no alcohol, restrictions on what food can be brought in the room, and often there is no access to outreach workers and other support that people rely on and need. On top of it all, people are being uprooted from neighborhoods in which they have deep relationships, to spots that are far away and unfamiliar. From what I've seen, most people come back within 24hrs, some get kicked out for stuff as stupid as \"smelling like weed\". These are adults we're talking about, full people, you know? It all seems like a great waste of time, energy and resources - there are so many paid city workers involved in every step of the process, not to mention the things we don't know of, involving the shelters themselves - the deals with developers/laundry services and so on. People need permanent housing, period. I've been doing this pretty much 7 days a week, unpaid. ESN @esn.4real.to is acting like some sort of agency, but we aren't one. I go to the park every day with ice, gatorade, water, socks, tarps, tents, sleeping bags, pillows, food, snacks, gift cards... lots of stuff, we get it all from donations. I've really gotten to know people and there is deep and mutual, love & respect. The city plans to move people out for a kids camp that wants to use the park. The problem, as they see it, is that there is a park full of people living in tents and a lot of those people use drugs. They have no real plan for housing, so they dance around with vaguery and try to move people without ..."

The pilot project offers resource clinics to reduce barriers to housing and has connected some residents to actual permanent rent-geared-to-income housing. However, the metric to determine the project's success is based on the reduction of tents in the park, rather than the number of people housed. This means that tents belonging to people with other tents or indoor spaces elsewhere, or belonging to newcomers/returnees setting up in the park, are targeted for immediate clearance without the offer of housing. While these kinds of evictions don't draw news crews, any forced displacementwhether done by a couple of bylaw officers or 200 militarized policeis violent. *see @esn.parkdale s linktree (in their bio) for the FULL TEXT version of this post.* #NoEncampmentEvictions",

[Image Description: Slide 1: An illustrated map of Toronto shows two dozen axonometric drawings of different building types (e.g. single family homes, modular homes, condo buildings, a shelter, a respite, a hotel, city hall), each representing a different aspect of the housing crisis. The buildings are surrounded by Torontos main highways (DVP, 401 and Gardiner) as well as the Don River, Lake Ontario and Toronto Islands. The illustration is titled Mapping the Housing Crisis. Slide 2: An inset illustration titled Homelessness shows a 3-storey apartment building, with an arrow leaving its front door that leads to three people, an adult and two youths, walking together along the path of a second arrow, toward a smaller house. Slide 3: The same illustrated map from Slide 1 is displayed as a watermark.]",

		"title": "From @esn.scadding On Tuesday July 20, 2021, the City of Toronto partnered with Toronto Police to violently evict yet another community of unhoused people living at Alexandra Park. The eviction followed the Citys now standard playbook: bringing in bus loads of highly armed riot police, street and horse cops, contract security, paddy wagons and drones in the early hours of the morning; enclosing residents and supporters in a cage of fences with this highly aggressive and militarized force; and violently dragging residents and supporters out of the cage by their arms and legs without any concern for their emotional, physical or mental states or abilities.  At this eviction, the City prohibited journalists from entering the cage to witness its violence, in direct violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Section 2b. One journalist was forcefully removed by private security and told he could not return to the park for three months.  Police targeted and arrested medics and legal observers ensuring that the attacks on particularly vulnerable park residents would not be observed or documented by supporters allowing the mayor to deliver his false narrative of a peaceful clearing. We have drafted a detailed report (2000 words!!) to dispel the misinformation that has been circulated about the Alexandra Park eviction by John Tory and City PR. Please read it.

During the early hours of Wednesday, July 21st, hundreds of police officers descended on Lamport Stadium Park. City workers proceeded to fence in encampment residents and their supporters. As a drone hovered overhead, security guards warned people to leave or face arrest for trespassing. Then, brandishing steel batons, police moved in. They hit someone in the face, breaking their nose and splitting open their forehead and lips. They slammed someone elses head into the pavement, leaving them with a concussion. They choked and tossed another person by their neck. Two people are now in casts and will require further X-rays to determine if bones were broken. Police punched, kicked, clubbed, and pepper-sprayed dozens of other people, and arrested 34. Encampment residents and their supporters were peacefully standing their ground that day, painting signs and having a barbeque. Residents refused to leave because they had nowhere else to go. At least 24 people lived at the Lamport encampment before the eviction. Almost all are still living outside, scattered to other parks in the city.  Some encampment residents wanted to move into shelters, but the City's own data shows it doesn't have enough beds to meet the demand. Many others have recently lived in the shelter system, but they returned to sleeping outside because they felt safer in encampments. People at Lamport wanted permanent housing. The City had none to offer.(cont.)",

The rest were either criminally charged at Lamport and detained at 14 Division, or arrested and charged while they gathered outside the station to demand the release of those detained. Most of the people detained at 14 Division were held into the night, with some released the following day. Many were released on the condition that they dont set foot in either Alexandra Park, Trinity Bellwoods, Lamport Stadium and Moss Park, ostensibly to prevent them from showing up to a future eviction. Many of those arrested have reported being treated badly by the police, including a person who uses a wheelchair who was detained and released only after police determined that their facilities were not accessible. A diabetic person was denied a blood sugar test at the site of their arrest.  In all of these evictions weve seen encampment residents more violently arrested, detained for longer, and released under more punitive conditions than supporters.  As of the evening of July 23rd, all have been released. Were following up and working to see that all charges are dropped.  More detailed statement to come. FOLLOW @esn.parkdale for more.",

Per residents request, ESN stood with them and witnessed as observers, and provided support with belongings. Multiple unhoused people, legal observers, and a journalist were unjustly targeted for arrest. As always, ESN takes care to align our conduct with the requests of self-determined encampment residents. This clearing took place without proper consultation or due respect for the human right to shelter. This was always the Citys goal, and there are at least two more encampments in their sights. There is a high likelihood that there will be an attempt to clear an encampment as early as tomorrow (July 21st). In contrast to those at Alexandra Park, residents at Lamport Stadium and Moss Park have been clear that their self-determined request is a stand your ground defence with help from supporters in the general public. Please join us at 5:00 a.m at 74 Fraser Ave (across the street from encampment) where you will receive further instructions. We also expect further targeted and un-targeted arrests. We will have legal observers and lawyers present and active on the phones, and will actively support those arrested to the best of our ability.",

		"title": "Impending Evictions Alert: Time to Support Your Unhoused Neighbours. FOLLOW @esn.to.moss.park @esn.scadding @esn.parkdale for news and critical updates from our neighbourhood committees.  The City of Toronto recently enacted major encampment eviction actions on May 19 at Lamport Stadium, which largely failed, and at Trinity Bellwoods on June 22. At Bellwoods the City unleashed a militarized force of over 200 police officers, private security, and city workers to violently displace the parks residents, many of whom have relocated to other encampments. At the time of writing, the fences the City erected to separate Trinity Bellwoods residents from their belongings and supporters are still there, patrolled 24/7 by private security. We expect further major clearance attempts by mayor John Tory and Toronto Police this week. Distinct Communities with Different Needs & Approaches As ever, the Encampment Support Network (ESNs) most basic commitment is to the self-determination of unhoused people in Toronto's downtown core. We are a network of autonomous neighborhood committees, each organizing within distinct communities. ESN has learned from what we have done well and less well at the recent Lamport and Trinity actions, and is building further capacity accordingly. Long collective experience shows that Toronto Police are especially vicious to poor people when no one is watching. Unhoused park residents in some spaces have primarily requested observation of clearance action rather than defense of their shelters. Residents in other parks have clearly indicated a desire for ESN, outreach volunteers, and the wider public to stand our ground with them in the face of further state violence. All encampments will have ESN support, but not all encampments have asked ESN to put out a public call-out on social media. (Continued in comments)",

On June 12th, The City of Toronto posted new trespass notices at Trinity Bellwoods Park, Alexandra Park, Moss Park, and Lamport Stadium Park, signalling another round of imminent, forced evictions for encampment residents. Their commitment to clearing encampments isnt about safety and care for their residents. It is, and has always been, about invisibilizing poverty.  Slide 2 reads: Safety. The notices position the Citys temporary indoor shelter spaces as safer alternatives, despite the intrusive bed checks and restrictions, lack of adequate harm reduction and overdose prevention supports, and frequent COVID-19 outbreaks. While the situation in encampments is not ideal, it remains the safest option for many. At least 36 people have died in City shelters in the first four months of 2021 alone. Slide 3: Policing. The last time the city tried to clear an encampment at Lamport Stadium Park, they used an absurd amount of violence, bringing dozens of private security and police. But they were countered by the incredible force of solidarity between community members and their unhoused neighbours, and they only managed to clear a small portion of the encampment. That plot of grass is now surveilled 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by a private security company contracted by the City of Toronto. Their job is to make sure nobody sleeps on that side of the park, and to call the police if they do. If The City succeeds in clearing the larger encampments, they openly plan to expand this model of round-the-clock policing of public space.]",

		"title": "Statement on the attempted clearing of the Lamport Stadium encampment: On Wednesday May 19th, the City of Toronto sent a massive force to clear the Lamport Stadium encampment and displace the people living there. Much of the media coverage so far highlights the extreme state violence enacted against residents, community members, and advocates. What the coverage largely overlooks is that residents and community supporters successfully defended the vast majority of encampment dwellings.  Roughly 60 City of Toronto corporate security guards and police officers (including eight on horseback), four people in Hazmat suits, a handful of other city workers, two claw heavy excavators and three dump trucks were only able to clear one tent and two wooden sheltersabout 10% of the encampmentafter trying in vain for most of the day. The City offered temporary shelter, not housing: On the morning of the scheduled clearing, Streets to Homes offered residents spots at four different temporary shelter hotels scattered across the city. Contrary to the City of Torontos public statement on the days events, no residents were offered actual housing. After making offers of temporary accommodation, City staff informed ESN Parkdale that clearing was not only imminent, but that those who had not accepted shelter hotel spots would be removed by force. Community support, not outside agitation: Community supporters have been painted as outside agitators by Mayor John Tory and others, implying that we acted against the wishes of encampment residents. To be clear: our response flows from the relationships weve made with Lamports residents over the course of a year of delivering the daily humanitarian aid that the city refuses to provide.  We were there to stand with those who chose to defend their homes against the City. We also sought to make sure that others could preserve their belongings as they prepared to move to shelter spaces on their own terms. Over the past couple of days, residents have told us they were proud to have fought back against the city and asked for an even greater community response next time.",

We expect theyll be coming to forcibly evict residents as soon as Monday. If residents dont leave, they can be arrested and fined up to $10,000.  A lot of Lamport residents want to stay where they are, because its their safest option.  One of the main reasons Lamport encampment exists is because its adjacent to the St. Felix respite, where some have beds, and people can access food and shower facilities occasionally. But since COVID, the respitewhich is just one big open space with cotsreduced their # of beds by half. And yet, we know many people who tested positive for COVID after prolonged stays inside the respite and other shelters over the winter months. There are currently 133 reported COVID cases in the shelter system, including 6 of the hotel shelters. Remember that the City didnt clear encampments after the April 6th notices of trespass, because they had a COVID outbreak in the Novotel shelter hotel weeks after it opened.  Were seeing a lot of people who initially accepted shelter hotel spots (often under coercion) return to encampments, with no belongings to speak of.  If people would rather sleep on the ground in a park than accept your alternatives, what does that say about the suitability\" of those alternatives? (continued in comments)",

[Slide 1]A Parapolice Force for Parks Defunding the police has become a defining issue of our time. Yet few people are talking about parapolice forces: police-adjacent teams used as a soft-arm of the law, which play their own role in enacting state violence and discrimination. The City of Torontos Parks Ambassadors are a prime example. You can recognize them by their yellow jackets and hi-vis vests. They are often the ones posting the notices of trespass that lead to forceful encampment evictions at the hands of police. Their practices are designed specifically to police poor and unhoused park users. Parks Ambassadors regularly surveil encampments, creating constant uncertainty and fear, and leading to the criminalization and displacement of residents. [Slide 2]Designed to Police Poverty The Parks Ambassadors program was first created in 2003 by then Parks manager Lucy Troisi, as a direct response to perceptions of safety in the Downtown Eastside. In Troisis own words: A combination of the emergency crisis of opioid-related deaths, an overwhelmed shelter system, a new cycle of problematic use of parks, and ongoing structural poverty issues have generated a true threat to the safety of our communities... What did the City do in response to this crisis? Create a parks patrol to push the people most affected by it out of sight. [Slide 3]Wellness Checks Parks Ambassadors say their job is to help encampment residents by doing safety and wellness checks that involve:Building meaningful relationships Providing residents with harm reduction supplies and informationEnsuring fire safetyGiving out basic needs like water and garbage bags (cont'd in comments)",

		"title": "On March 31st Sarah Rehou, a burn unit specialist that helped in developing a fire training manual for encampment residents, met with people living in Clarence Square Park to do the first outdoor fire safety training.  The manual (theres a video of its contents in here)was made as a response to Toronto Fire refusing to follow the recommendations of the Faulkner Inquest and instead, for the past 6 months, just delivering a leaflet to encampment residents stating what they shouldnt do. (See red hot pic) What we know is that they dont seek to provide services that would aid in safer heat source, or education around fire with good suggestions for safety. Its simply a list of what you shouldnt do with focus on taking away what is viewed as unsafe. We see Toronto Fire consistently confiscating life-preserving heat sources with no reasonable offer of alternatives. Clarence Square residents themselves have been subject to harassment from Fire and Police over a bundle of wood used for heat, food, and sacred fire. In place of it, they offered only some socks and water.  So, enter the development of encampment fire safety training. A manual made in collaboration with encampment residents, representatives from the burn research community , and organizations that do street outreach including Sanctuary Toronto, The Encampment Support Network (ESN), and The Common Table at Redeemer. The manual focuses on best fire practices with practical ways to engage with fire, deal with frostbite, and tips to stay warm- something that Toronto Fire could easily have come up with themselves, but they did not.  It was a wonderful training, very conversational and informative. Residents often speak to their experiences with fire, creating new levels of understanding and sharing. Its beautiful. Community takes care of itself. Weve learned a lot from residents and they continue to learn a lot from each other.  Across the street from Clarence Square a restaurant tent with a raging fire burns. Why is one sanctioned while the other is criminalized?",

		"title": "APRIL 4th UPDATE ON ENCAMPMENT EVICTIONS On March 19th 2021, the City of Toronto posted Notices of Trespass on dwellings belonging to encampment residents in Moss Park, Trinity Bellwoods, Alexandra Park, Lamport Stadium, Allan Gardens, Cherry Beach and elsewhere, stating that they have until April 6th at 8:00 AM to clear out of parks and other public spaces. This was part of their Pathway Inside Program, the latest move in an ongoing effort to criminalize and invisiblize unhoused people.  On Thursday April 1st 2021, the City of Toronto announced that no enforcement action to vacate parks will occur on April 6th. Could it have been the thousands of people who have called upon their City Councillors and Mayor to halt encampment eviction efforts? Or, could it be that 45 The Esplanade is the latest site of a COVID-19 outbreak within the Citys shelter system, forcing Toronto Public Health to temporarily suspend intakes at the PIPs main referral site? JUST A TEMPORARY REPRIEVE Make no mistake: the City of Toronto is temporarily putting off encampment clearings because the situation at 45 The Esplanade has made it so that the continued displacement of encampment residents into an indoor setting with growing COVID cases is plainly indefensible. Yet, according to the news release and some City Councillors, encampment residents are the cause of COVID-19 outbreaks in indoor congregate settings. This reveals a critical misunderstanding of the realities of unhoused people, many of whom regularly access drop-in services and cycle in and out of indoor shelter spaces even as they continue to dwell in and return to encampments.  City officials have scrambled to reconfigure the  Notice of Trespass, which threatened $10,000 fines and physical removal from the site by Special Constables. In his interview with Metro Morning on March 30th, Brad Ross contended that the Notice of Trespass was simply a way of setting a deadline for encampment residents. The Citys press release states: The notice posted in parks in March identified a date of April 6th to guide peoples decision-making regarding offers of shelter, housing and other supports being offered. ...",

I want it to spread like wildfire through the alleyways and avenues, through every tent and tiny shelter in every encampment. I want it to become a lesson, the thing of legend. The story of resistance, a single man who fought a city hellbent on destroying him.  Derrick lived in a tent in Moss Park and refused to leave unless he was housed in the neighbourhood.  He refused to get swept into a shelter system that he didnt feel safe in. He has never given up hope. He fought for himself, and for the people. I think back and remember him saying over and over, Im not leaving until I get housing. I want a place with a door and a key and he didnt ever budge. He held his ground. The city tried with all their might, they threw everything at him - forced evictions, threats of fines and police - so he sued them, saying that what they were doing went against his basic human rights.  Today marks a massive victory. This is Derricks new home, a one bedroom apartment in his neighbourhood in Moss Park.  Derrick told me to tell people, Keep fighting, stay strong - dont give up hope. Today we sat around and watched the video that AK sent us of the aftermath of Derricks home being destroyed by the police, who in the middle of the night some time this summer, claimed they were looking for a gun, kept him in handcuffs while they were searching and found nothing. They tore down his home and destroyed his possessions.  The city would have you believe that encampments are dangerous, yet the main perpetrators of violence is the city itself.  Send Derrick your blessings in the comments and well relay them to him.  Also - he could use a light brown area rug,  pillows, beige curtains.

The largest spike in COVID cases in a two-month period since the beginning of the pandemic, and no clear, achievable contingencies to address this spike, let alone factor in COVID variants.A burnt out frontline, who have upheld homelessness services for a year in the absence of adequate government intervention. An inadequate long-term plan to address the need for affordable housing, let alone safe, stable, healthy transitional housing until permanent housing is built.The continuation of evictions, both residential and of encampments.The crucial need to ensure that shelter-hotels are functional for as long as is necessary, let alone a need to create more shelter-hotel spaces as well as safe daytime spaces for people sleeping rough.The situation is untenable, and at the cusp of a crisis which could decimate and even end lives. Advocates and the frontline of agencies have held up supports for people experiencing homelessness with inadequate support for a year. Change needs to happen, NOW.
