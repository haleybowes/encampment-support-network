00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,946
I'm not going nowhere. The
struggles and the things I've

2
00:00:03,946 --> 00:00:06,586
gone through since I first came
to this park in the very

3
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:10,186
beginning how many times I've
had to start over because it

4
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:17,646
didn't stole my attention my
stuff. The system. You might as

5
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:21,966
well go to jail. a thing goes
for the hotels. They're just a

6
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:25,966
new shelter system rather than
a hotel. They're downgraded to

00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:32,446

00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:37,806
have family my nieces can't
come and visit me. You don't

00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:46,526
hear. In me experience that. I
haven't had before I've been

10
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:50,046
homeless pretty much my whole
life.

11
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:59,126
I don't feel home when I'm here
this is home and.
