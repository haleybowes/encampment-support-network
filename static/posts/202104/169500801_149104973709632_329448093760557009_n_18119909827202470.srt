00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,263
My second question is we are
aware that a collision of

2
00:00:04,263 --> 00:00:08,743
lawyers plans on pursuing legal
action against the city related

3
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:13,383
to the clearing of encampments
in parks. By April 6. Advocates

4
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:16,903
are concerned that this notice
will lead to mass displacement

5
00:00:16,903 --> 00:00:20,343
of vulnerable people during the
pandemic. Are you still going

6
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:26,583
to clear the encampments in
early April and why now? I

7
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,063
would just say that what we
have done in this case is to

8
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:31,863
put together a very carefully
and thoughtfully put together a

9
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:37,303
plan to move people who are in
encampments in public parks to

10
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:40,023
better housing to permanent
housing. These encampments are

11
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:43,463
not safe. They are not healthy
and they do not belong in

12
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:46,743
public parks. They're not to be
in public parks, but we're not

13
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:49,463
just clearing them out. We are
proceeding that by extensive

14
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:52,183
work that is going on right now
to talk to each and every one

15
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:55,303
of those individuals and find
them better housing housing

16
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:58,243
that is. Indoors and that is
going to be much more suited to

17
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:02,003
humane treatment of those
people.
